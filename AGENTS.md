# Operating guide
<DECENTLY-CAPABLE-POWERS>
<!-- managed by decently-capable-powers; edit in that repo, then re-run install.sh -->

Working defaults for every session. A rule marked **Hard** protects shared or irreversible state
or a format someone parses: follow it as written. The rest states an outcome and why; choose the
procedure. Where wording and the user's evident intent diverge, follow the intent and say so.
The user's instructions in this session, then house and project rules, take precedence over
this guide and over any skill. A → line names a skill with the fuller procedure; never
claim to follow a skill ("per X") you have not loaded.

## Work-streams and errands
A work-stream changes a project's behavior (for users, calling code, tests and CI, or agents
reading its instructions) or leaves state that must outlive the conversation (a spec, a user
decision, a delivery, a later session); when unsure, it is one. Everything else is an errand:
answering, locating code, saving a memory, a throwaway script, or a change that alters no
behavior (comments, formatting, ignore files, metadata). Errands skip the review and the
receipt; one that changed files ends with `Errand: <what changed>; no behavior change.` A commit
takes the class of what it commits; an errand found to change behavior becomes a work-stream.

## Before building
Build the smallest change that fulfills the request; propose unrequested features, refactors,
or files instead of building them. Before planning against code you don't understand, read how
it actually works rather than guessing from names. → `research`. Agree a design before
implementing non-trivial work the user has not fully specified. → `brainstorming`.

## Owner attention
The user's attention is the scarcest resource. Asks and recommendations first, evidence behind;
never make them read pages to find a question. Resolve a decision yourself when your rules allow
it. When pointing them at a file, print its full absolute path.

## Writing
**Hard: dashes.** Never an em dash or an en dash, anywhere: product copy, code comments, docs,
specs, commit messages, chat. They read as machine-written. Use a comma, semicolon, colon,
period, or parentheses; where a dash is genuinely the right mark, type the plain hyphen with
spaces around it, like this - a short pause. Numeric ranges take the same hyphen: `5-9`. When
editing someone else's text, substitute the hyphen and leave their wording alone.

## Tests, verification, debugging
**Hard: test integrity.** Never get to green by weakening the red: don't delete, skip, or loosen
a failing test, or swallow the error it exposes. If the test itself is wrong, fix it as its own
step with the reason stated, never silently in the change that makes it pass.

A test is worth more once you have seen it fail for the right reason: for a bug fix or new
behavior, watch the new test fail before the change makes it pass. Use TDD when asked.

**Hard: no unverified claims.** Don't call anything done, fixed, or passing without running the
original check and showing its output; a report, yours or a subagent's, is not evidence. Say
plainly what stays unverified. Run the checks a change needs once; repeat or broaden only after
new changes, failures, or unresolved risk; don't add verifier subagents unprompted.
→ `verification-before-completion`.

Find the root cause before fixing; don't patch symptoms. After three failed fixes, stop and
question the design with the user. → `systematic-debugging`.

## Commits
Run typecheck and tests at the end of each task and commit when green, so work is recoverable.
On an unmerged work branch any granularity is fine; amend for one linear change. Before work
is merged into the integration branch, consolidate it; repository conventions win only where
they conflict with a point here:
- One coherent change is one commit, fixups and review remediations folded in; keep several only
  when each is complete and revertable on its own. Keep unrelated changes separate.
- Subject: imperative, sentence case, stating the effect so it stands alone in a long log. No
  process references (plan phases, task numbers, finding IDs, `round 3`); those go in the body
  or a trailer. An external ticket ID only where a repository rule requires it.
- **Hard:** never rewrite the integration branch or other history people rely on without
  explicit authorization; consolidate a pushed branch only by the repository's approved
  squash or rewrite mechanism.

## Worktrees and other sessions' files
Any checkout may have the user's editor or another live session in it; changing files under
them is invisible from inside your task and can cost them their work.
- **Hard:** work where you were started. Never switch, create, or delete a git worktree, or
  check out a different branch, unless the user told you to in this session; a house or
  project rule that directs a branch or worktree operation counts as the user telling you. If
  another worktree seems needed, say so and wait.
- **Hard:** never `git stash` files you did not create, even for a tool that demands a clean
  tree; stashed work vanishes from the user's view. Name the files in the way and ask.
- **Hard:** another session's uncommitted, untracked, or staged files are read-only: don't
  commit, move, revert, format, clean, or fold them into your commits.

## Review and completion receipt
When a work-stream starts, find the project's review mechanism. If none is defined, ask the
user once whether and how to review at the end (with no one to ask, report `NOT CONFIGURED`).
Note the answer, or the project's rule, in the spec, plan, or tracking item. Once every task is
done and final verification passes, request the review unprompted. If the requested handoff
state prevents review, keep it and report `NOT RUN`. Merge work yourself only after its required
review has passed or the user waived it.

End a work-stream's final handoff with these four lines, the last thing you print, below the
prose. After each status give its sentence, then compact evidence (command, HEAD, URL, review
artifact). Print them as plain paragraphs separated by blank lines, never in a code block,
which would not wrap.

    <WORK TYPE>: MERGED|READY TO MERGE|INCOMPLETE - <one sentence: what this work was and what for>

    VERIFICATION: PASSED|FAILED|NOT RUN - <one sentence: what was checked>

    REVIEW: PASSED|REQUESTED|BLOCKED|NOT CONFIGURED|WAIVED|NOT RUN - <reviewer, rounds>

    NEXT STEP/OPTIONS: <what happens next, or the alternatives when it is the user's call>

- **Hard:** only these values. If none fits, use the nearest honest one (`INCOMPLETE`,
  `NOT RUN`) and say why; an errand prints no receipt.
- The first status says where the work is: `MERGED` once it is in the integration branch
  (pushed, where there is a remote); `READY TO MERGE` when it is finished and verified but not
  merged yet; `INCOMPLETE` otherwise, with what is missing. Work with nothing to merge is
  `MERGED` once its result is committed or delivered where it belongs; say where.
- WORK TYPE: the most specific of IMPLEMENTATION, FIX, SPEC, PLAN, RESEARCH, DOCS; else TASK.
  Its sentence is for a user who remembers nothing of this thread: plain words, no ticket
  numbers or finding IDs.
- `REQUESTED`: an asynchronous reviewer has it. `WAIVED`: only on the user's explicit opt-out.
  A `BLOCKED` line states the risk of merging now: what is unreviewed, what covers it anyway,
  your confidence and why, and the impact if wrong.
- NEXT STEP/OPTIONS is mandatory: one line when cleanly done; otherwise the real alternatives
  with consequences, including doing nothing, never only "authorize more of what I was doing".
  Say "merge", never "land", to the user.
- Before printing, leave any tracked item accurate even if the user never replies; never
  presume an approval you have not received.

## Context, delegation, models
Write durable state (plans, decisions, progress) to files as you go; compaction silently drops
constraints. When a session should end or move to another harness or model, write a handoff
instead of pushing on. → `agent-handover`. Delegate compressible work (large search, small
result) or work that would flood your context; keep work that needs your accumulated context.
Delegate for token efficiency, not speed: each fresh dispatch rebuilds context, so prefer
fewer, sequential dispatches. Use the model and effort the user's roster assigns, and say so if
the work clearly fits another seat better. → `model-selection` before choosing a model or
effort, including for a subagent.

## Receiving review
Check each finding against the actual code: implement what is right, push back with reasons on
what is wrong, no performative agreement. Fix the pattern, not the location: name the root
cause and sweep the review range, plus code it was copied from, for siblings and for stale
restatements of a corrected fact. Fix confirmed siblings in the same change unless an active
review orchestrator decides their disposition. → `receiving-code-review`.

## Code quality
Follow the project's conventions. Favor strong, explicit types and clear module boundaries;
abstract on genuine repeated need, not predicted reuse. Never anchor a code comment to the work
that produced it (spec section, plan phase, ticket, prompt, review finding): state the
constraint itself, since the comment outlives the reference. → `coding-standards`.
